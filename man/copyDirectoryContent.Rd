\usage{
copyDirectoryContent(source.dir, target.dir, overwrite = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{source.dir}{Character string. Path to the source directory to copy from.}

\item{target.dir}{Character string. Path to the target directory to copy to.
Will be created if it doesn't exist.}

\item{overwrite}{Logical. Whether to overwrite existing files in the target
directory. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
Logical. Returns \code{TRUE} if all items were copied successfully,
  \code{FALSE} if any items failed to copy. The result is returned invisibly.
}
\description{
Recursively copies all directories, subdirectories, and files from a source
directory to a target directory, with option to overwrite existing files.
Progress messages are displayed during the copy operation, and a summary
is provided upon completion.
}
\details{
This function performs a complete recursive copy of a directory structure,
including all subdirectories and files. It will:
\itemize{
  \item Validate that the source directory exists
  \item Create the target directory if it doesn't exist
  \item Recursively copy all files and directories
  \item Display progress messages for each copied item
  \item Provide a summary of the operation upon completion
}

If any files or directories fail to copy, warnings will be displayed and
the function will return \code{FALSE}, but it will continue attempting
to copy remaining items.

# Basic usage
copyDirectoryContent(
  source.dir = "/path/to/source",
  target.dir = "/path/to/target"
)

# Copy without overwriting existing files
copyDirectoryContent(
  source.dir = "~/documents",
  target.dir = "~/backup",
  overwrite = FALSE
)

# Check if copy was successful
success <- copyDirectoryContent(
  source.dir = "./data",
  target.dir = "./backup/data"
)
if (success) {
  cat("All files copied successfully!\n")
} else {
  cat("Some files failed to copy. Check warnings.\n")
}
}
